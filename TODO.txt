if(this.household) {
  this.ds.editHousehold(this.model);
  this.contacts.forEach(this.ds.editContact);
} else {
  var key = this.ds.addHousehold(this.model);

  this.contacts.forEach(contact => {
    contact.household = key;
    this.ds.addContact(contact)
  });
}



new components:
  contact-add (modal)
  contact subform (use in household form)
  household-add
  household-subform (minor refactor, we largely already deal with edit logic in view component)

rename view to householdview
remove form-dialog?

search
 - rename component
 - change elastic indexing (can we do lookups in that script to grab household detail?)
 - consider that search might be part of booking workflow. callback?

calendar
 - workflow first!
 - orphan contacts
 - rebook logic
